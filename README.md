# The Chapel  --  Venue Booking Application

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to build an attractively styled web application with two main functions: the user visiting the site would be able to easily request a reservation date and the owner of the site would be able to view all of their requests and interact with them in one place.

## Live Deployment
https://thechapel.netlify.app/

## Backend Repository
https://github.com/jalynnjk/venue-booking-app-backend

## Technologies
The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, React, React-Boostrap, React Router, React Context, Axios, React-Calendar, Moment, and React-Scroll

## Installation
To install this application fork and then clone this repository into your local terminal. (Make sure to run `npm i` in order to download the required dependencies)

## Next steps...
For my next steps I would like to add authorization where the owner must log-in in order to view and interact with the requests. I would also like to add the functionality where the application automatically sends an email to the user letting them know if their request has been accepted or declined.
